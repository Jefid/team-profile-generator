## Installation
First Install Node.js <br>
Then you'll need to use the terminal to run "npm init" and "npm install inquirer". <br>
Next run "npm install jest --save-dev" in the terminal. <br>
Next, open the package.json file. Note that the scripts property already has a "test" property. Go ahead and change that value to jest. <br>

## Usage
Open the command line and run "node app" and then answer each question prompted. After completing the questionnaire your HTML file will be written in the dist folder of the application! ("./dist/index.html")
